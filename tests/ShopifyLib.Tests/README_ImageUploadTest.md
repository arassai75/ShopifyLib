# Image Upload GraphQL Test

This test demonstrates uploading an image to Shopify using the GraphQL `fileCreate` mutation and displays all response details including image dimensions and metadata.

## Test Specification

The test fulfills the following requirements:

1. ‚úÖ **Uses the specified image URL**: `https://dynamic.images.ca/v1/gifts/gifts/673419406239/1.jpg?width=810&maxHeight=810&quality=85`
2. ‚úÖ **Uploads to Shopify without attaching to any product or variant**: Uses GraphQL `fileCreate` mutation
3. ‚úÖ **Displays all Shopify response details**: Shows complete JSON response, file ID, status, dimensions, etc.
4. ‚úÖ **Uses GraphQL service**: Leverages the `IGraphQLService` and `FileService` for upload

## What the Test Does

### 1. Image Upload Process
- Creates a `FileCreateInput` with the specified  image URL
- Uses `FileContentType.Image` to indicate it's an image file
- Sets alt text for accessibility
- Calls `_client.Files.UploadFilesAsync()` which uses GraphQL under the hood

### 2. Response Details Displayed
The test displays comprehensive information about the uploaded file:

#### Basic File Information
- **File ID**: The unique GraphQL ID (e.g., `gid://shopify/MediaImage/123456789`)
- **File Status**: Processing status (`READY`, `UPLOADED`, etc.)
- **Alt Text**: Accessibility description
- **Created At**: Timestamp of creation

#### Image Dimensions
- **Width**: Image width in pixels
- **Height**: Image height in pixels
- **Aspect Ratio**: Calculated width/height ratio

#### Shopify CDN URLs
- **Shopify CDN URL**: The main CDN URL for the image
- **Original Source**: The original source URL
- **Transformed Source**: URL with any transformations applied
- **Primary Source**: The primary source URL (usually same as CDN URL)

#### GraphQL ID Details
- **Full GraphQL ID**: Complete identifier
- **Resource Type**: Type of media (MediaImage)
- **Numeric ID**: Extracted numeric identifier

#### Complete Response
- **Full JSON Response**: Complete Shopify response in formatted JSON
- **Error Information**: Any user errors or validation issues
- **File Count**: Number of files in the response

## How to Run the Test

## Technical Details

### GraphQL Mutation Used
The test uses the Shopify GraphQL `fileCreate` mutation:
```graphql
mutation fileCreate($files: [FileCreateInput!]!) {
  fileCreate(files: $files) {
    files {
      id
      fileStatus
      alt
      createdAt
      ... on MediaImage {
        image {
          width
          height
          url
          originalSrc
          transformedSrc
          src
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Features
- **URL-based upload**: Uses the image URL directly without downloading
- **No product attachment**: Image is uploaded to Shopify's media library only
- **Complete metadata**: Retrieves all available file information
- **Error handling**: Displays any user errors or validation issues
- **Formatted output**: Easy-to-read console output with emojis and sections

### Files Created
1. `tests/ShopifyLib.Tests/ImageUploadGraphQLTest.cs` - Main test file
2. `samples/ConsoleApp/ImageUploadExample.cs` - Standalone example class
3. Updated `samples/ConsoleApp/Program.cs` - Added demo method
4. `tests/ShopifyLib.Tests/README_ImageUploadTest.md` - This documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Invalid credentials**: Ensure your Shopify API credentials are correct
2. **Network issues**: The image URL must be publicly accessible
3. **API permissions**: Ensure your access token has file upload permissions
4. **Rate limiting**: Shopify may throttle requests if too many are made

### Error Messages
- `GraphQL errors`: Check your GraphQL query syntax
- `User errors`: Validation issues with the input data
- `Network errors`: Connectivity or URL accessibility issues

## Notes
- The image is uploaded to Shopify's media library but not attached to any product
- The test uses the GraphQL service as specified in the requirements
- All response details are displayed in a comprehensive, readable format
- The test includes proper error handling and validation
